GoReplace!

    REGEX + Collections = GoReplace!
    This tool does the obvious: it will find and replace content. It should 
    be easy.

Installation

    Files go into the Products directory. Then restart.
    NOTE: You have to rename the extracted folder to "GoReplace".

Usage

   1. Add a 'GoReplacement' object somewhere on a site.
   2. Give it a name, and fill out all the fields.
   3. Select a Collection object somewhere on your site.
   4. Click the tab 'preview' and then 'run'.
   5. If you want to execute the shown replacements click "wet run".
   6. That's it.

Notes

    You can use regex capture groups or matching modes in your replacements, 
    see http://www.regular-expressions.info/python.html for profound 
    documentation. If you uncheck the checkbox called 'Regex' text based 
    replacements will be made.
